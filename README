NAME
    POE::Declare - A POE abstraction layer for conciseness and simplicity

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: THIS CODE IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND MADE BE CHANGED OR DELETED
    ENTIRELY WITHOUT NOTICE

    POE is a very powerful and flexible system for doing asynchronous
    programming.

    But personally, I find it confusing and tricky to use at times.

    In particular, I have found it hard to resolve POE's way of programming
    with the highly abstracted OO that I am used to, with layer stacked upon
    layer ad-infinitum.

    I have found this particularly noticable as the scale of a codebase gets
    later. At three levels of abstraction the layering become quite
    difficult, and beyond this it became worse and worse.

    POE::Declare is my attempt to resolve this problem by locking down some
    of the traditional flexibility of POE, and by (hopefully) makeing it
    easier to split the implementation of each object between an
    object-oriented half and a POE half.

    This will hopefully allow me to utilise POE's asynchronous nature, while
    retaining the traditional codebase scaling capability provided by normal
    OO.

    Of course, this entire exercise is something of a grand experiment and
    it may well turn out that I am wrong. But I think I'm heading in the
    right general direction (I just don't know if I'm taking quite the right
    path).

METHODS
    For the first few releases, I plan to leave this module undocumented.

    That I am releasing this distribution at all is more of a way to mark my
    progress, and to allow other POE/OO people to look at the implementation
    and comment.
