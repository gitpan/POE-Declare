=head1 NAME

POE::Declare::Meta::Slot - Abstract base class for named class elements

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In L<POE::Declare>, each class is a simple controlled structure with a set
of named elements within it, known as "slots".

Each slot uniquely occupies a name (just like in a HASH) except that in the
L<POE::Declare> model, that name is reserved across all resources (the
method name, the HASH key, and in some cases certain method names below the
root name as well).

For example, a slot named "foo" of type C<Param> will consume the HASH key
"foo", have an accessor method "foo", and take a "foo" parameter in the 
object constructor.

A slot named "mytimeout" filled with a C<Timeout> will consume the
"mytimeout" HASH key, and may have methods such as C<mytimeout_alarm>,
C<mytimeout_keepalive> and C<mytimeout_clear>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  # You cannot create a Slot directly
  my $object = POE::Declare::Meta::Attribute->new(
      name => 'foo',
  );

The default slot constructor takes a list of named parameters, and creates
a C<HASH>-based object using them. The default implementation does not
check its parameters, as it expects them to be provided by other functions
which themselves will have already checked params.
