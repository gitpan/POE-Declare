=head1 NAME

POE::Declare::Meta::Event - Declares a named POE event

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Declare;
  
  sub shutdown : Event {
      my $self = $_[SELF];
  
      # Shutdown our child first
      $self->child->post('shutdown');
  
      # Wait for the child to tell us it is finished
      return 1;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Taking advantage of the subroutine attribute feature of recent versions
of Perl, the C<Event> attribute is used to register a function/method as
an event that can be targetted by POE events.

In an Event, the non-core parameter constant SELF is used to retrieve
the current object (Since all objects are stored in the session heap,
SELF is actually just an alias for HEAP).
