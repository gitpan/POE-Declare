=head1 NAME

POE::Declare::Meta::Param - A named attribute passed to the constructor
as a parameter.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<POE::Declare::Meta::Param> is a sub-class of
L<POE::Declare::Meta::Attribute>. It defines an attribute for which the
initial value will be passed by name to the constructor.

The declaration does not concern itself with issues of type or
whether the param is required. These types of issues are left as a concern
for the implementation.

After the object has been created, the parameter will be read-only.

Any values that should be controllable after object creation should be
changed via a custom method or event that understands the statefulness of
the object, and will make the actual change to the attribute at the correct
time, and in the correct manner.

By default, every class is assigned a default C<Alias> parameter.

This parameter represents the name of the object, which should be unique at
a process level for the duration of the entire process and persist across
multiple starting and stopping of the object (if it supports stopping and
restarting).

By default, each object is assigned a name based on the class and an
incrementing number. A typical Alias might be "Class::Name.123".

If you wish to override this with your own name for an object, you are free
to do so.
