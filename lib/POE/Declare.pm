=head1 NAME

POE::Declare - A POE abstraction layer for conciseness and simplicity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING: THIS CODE IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND MADE BE CHANGED
OR DELETED ENTIRELY WITHOUT NOTICE>

L<POE> is a very powerful and flexible system for doing asynchronous
programming.

But personally, I find it confusing and tricky to use at times.

In particular, I have found it hard to resolve L<POE>'s way of
programming with the highly abstracted OO that I am used to,
with layer stacked upon layer ad-infinitum.

I have found this particularly noticable as the scale of a
codebase gets later. At three levels of abstraction the layering
become quite difficult, and beyond this it became worse and worse.

B<POE::Declare> is my attempt to resolve this problem by locking
down some of the traditional flexibility of POE, and by (hopefully)
makeing it easier to split the implementation of each object between
an object-oriented half and a POE half. 

This will hopefully allow me to utilise POE's asynchronous nature,
while retaining the traditional codebase scaling capability
provided by normal OO.

Of course, this entire exercise is something of a grand experiment
and it may well turn out that I am wrong. But I think I'm heading
in the right general direction (I just don't know if I'm taking
quite the right path).

=head1 METHODS

For the first few releases, I plan to leave this module undocumented.

That I am releasing this distribution at all is more of a way to
mark my progress, and to allow other POE/OO people to look at the
implementation and comment.
