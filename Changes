Changes for Perl extension POE-Declare

0.52 Mon 7 Mar 2011
	- Adding check for event declaration on finalised class
	- Adding check for use of an uncompiled class
	- Moved dependency version checks into module code
	- Removing apparently redundant IO::File dependency

0.51 Wed 23 Feb 2011
	- Renaming _compile to as_perl
	- Bumped the POE dependency again
	- Fixed a POD typo

0.50 Thu 21 Oct 2010
	- Major upgrade, not backward compatible in all cases.
	- Bumped the POE dependency as I am struggling to test against
	  older ones.
	- Timeout events are now implemented using POE named timers
	  rather than numbered timers. The implementation is much
	  closer to POE's prefered usage, and results in significantly
	  less code in 80% less code in generated timeout code.
	- Added the new method ->finish, which will clear all timers
	  and remove the session alias. It should be called when you
	  are ready for your session to be shut down.
	  The finish method MUST be called while in the session you
	  are calling it on. Removed the _finish event.
	- Removed the _alias_set and _alias_remove events. With the
	  introduction of the finish method, we fully control all
	  the places where the session alias needs to be created and
	  removed. Direct user access to this is now unneeded and
	  likely to be a source of bugs.
	- Any code previously using _alias_remove directly to do their
	  equivalent of what the finish method now does will break.

0.26 Mon 19 Jul 2010
	- Updating to Module::Install 1.00
	- Added _finish event which clears all timeouts and removes the
	  alias. Intended to be a common way to say "I'm done now".
	- Added alternate compile-time hash usage for declarations.
	- Corrected timeout_start bug where restarts were being done via
	  non-existant method timeout_clear.

0.25 Thu 27 May 2010
	- Updating to Module::Install 0.97
	- Updating Class::XSAccessor dependency to faster 1.05
	- Expanding documentation

0.24 Thu  8 Oct 2009
	- Moving child disconnection change to production version.
	- Bumping Test::POE::Stopping dependency to 1.05 for increased
	  rigour of stop validation.

0.23_01 Fri 11 Sep 2009
	- Experimental change, immediately disconnect every session from
	  their parent at _start time so that we never use POE's internal
	  child session reference tracking.

0.22 Wed 12 Aug 2009
	- Fixing some bugs in Message events, and improved tests for it.

0.21 Thu 19 Mar 2009
        - Improved checking of Message params
        - Adding an Alias format check

0.20 Tue 17 Mar 2009
	- Disable Test::NoWarnings when using Test::POE::Stopping.
	  It uses POE::Peek::API, which will throw a warnings when
	  loaded against a development version of POE.
	- Adding a specific META.yml dependency check.

0.19 Tue 17 Mar 2009
	- Allowing Message params to be optional

0.18 Fri 13 Mar 2009

	- Adding POD documentation for _alias_remove
	- Moving the events into their own documentation section

0.16 Fri 13 Mar 2009
	- Adding missing Test::Exception dependency
	- Dropping the superfluous timeout_start method

0.15 Fri 13 Mar 2009
	- Moving package_states and params to private methods
	- Add strict checking of constructor params
	- POE::Declare::Object->meta is not code-generated per-class

0.14 Thu 12 Mar 2009
	- Adding the initial implementation of Timeout that actually works

0.13 Wed 11 Mar 2009
	- Adding a missing dependency on Test::NoWarnings

0.12 Tue 10 Mar 2009

0.09 Thu  5 Mar 2009
	- Converting all simple accessors to Class::XSAccessor
	- Switching to a better and faster error check in lookback

0.08 Thu  5 Mar 2009
	- Adding tests for half a dozen or so more methods
	- Fixed a bug in ->lookback

0.07 Thu  5 Mar 2009
	- compile is now prototyped ()
	- package_states caches now, making spawning faster

0.06 Wed  4 Mar 2009
